#Tuple in Python: Check Element Existence
## Aim
To write a Python program that checks if the element `'n'` and the element `8` exist within a given tuple.
## Algorithm
1. Define a tuple `x` with some letters and numbers.
2. Use the `in` operator to check if the string `'n'` exists within the tuple.
3. Use the `in` operator to check if the integer `8` exists within the tuple.
4. Print the results.
## Program
```
t = ("s", 8, "a", "v", "n", "g", "u", "r", "c", "e")
print(8 in t)
print('n' in t)
```
## Output

## Result
Thus the program that checks if the element `'n'` and the element `8` exist within a given tuple has been executed successfully.
